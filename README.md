# Multi-Model Exercise

This exercise details the process of using InterSystems IRISÂ® data platform multi-model capability to create a Node.js application that  sends JSON data straight to your database instance without any parsing or mapping. 

In this exercise, we will use Python, JavaScript, and InterSystems ObjectScript to interact with data from different contexts, following these steps:
1.	Use Python to create a table schema using standard SQL statements.
2.  Modify the underlying ObjectScript class for that table to allow it to receive and persist JSON data directly.
3.  Create a simple Node.js application that will send JSON files to the instance of InterSystems IRIS. 
4.	Query that database using Python again to see how the same data could be accessed in multiple languages from multiple contexts.
